# Bachelor Thesis: Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Approaches for AI in Supertuxkart Soccer Mode Bots

This repository contains the code and resources used for my Bachelor Thesis at **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam**. The research explores the effectiveness of three distinct machine learning approaches in developing AI bots for the soccer mode of the open-source game **Supertuxkart**. The full paper can be found on the "main" branch.

## Abstract

The study compares:
1. **Scoring Model**: A simple machine learning model for evaluating actions.
2. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Model**: An adaptive approach leveraging real-time feedback.
3. **Enhanced Scoring Model**: A scoring model enhanced with higher-level in-game functions.

### Key Findings:
- The **RL model** demonstrated potential for adaptive and strategic decision-making.
- The **enhanced scoring model** outperformed the baseline AI, achieving **72 wins in 100 games**.
